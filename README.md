# This repo is about my `Dockerplates`

This Repository **Dockerplates** is my personal docker-compose file collection that I use on my homelab server. Here you can find templates, and configurations for a dashboard for all your services, docker containers, a discord bot for creating images based on your current rio in WoW with a few other functions and a self hosted media server.

> :warning: Be aware that products change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases in my free time, but please understand that this wonâ€™t always be the case.

I created them as free resources to be used in your homelab environment servers if you choose to use them. Keep in mind to tailor them to your specific infrastructure as they do not contain the environment variables or tokens needed to function correctly.

## Showcase
